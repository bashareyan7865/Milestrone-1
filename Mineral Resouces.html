        Minerals provide the material used to make most of the things of industrial- based society; roads, cars, computers, fertilizers, etc. Demand for minerals is increasing world wide as the population increases and the consumption demands of individual people increase. The mining of earth’s natural resources is, there­fore accelerating, and it has accompanying environmental consequences.
    </p>
    <br>
    <p>A mineral is a pure inorganic substance that occurs naturally in the earth’s crust. All of the Earth’s crust, except the rather small proportion of the crust that contains organic material, is made up of minerals. Some minerals consist of a single element such as gold, silver, diamond (carbon), and sulphur.</p>
    <br>
    <p>More than two-thousand minerals have been identified and most of these contain inorganic compounds formed by various combinations of the eight elements (O, Si, Al, Fe, Ca, Na, K, and Mg) that make up 98.5% of the Earth’s crust. Industry depends on about 80 of the known minerals.</p>
<br>
<p>A mineral deposit is a concentration of naturally occurring solid, liquid, or gaseous material, in or on the Earth’s crust in such form and amount that its extraction and its conversion into useful materials or items are profitable now or may be so in the future. Mineral resources are non-renewable and include metals (e.g. iron, copper, and aluminum), and non-metals (e.g. salt, gypsum, clay, sand, phosphates).</p>
<br>
<p>Minerals are valuable natural resources being finite and non-renewable. They constitute the vital raw materials for many basic industries and are a major resource for development. Management of mineral resources has, therefore, to be closely integrated with the overall strategy of development; and exploitation of minerals is to be guided by long-term national goals and perspectives.</p>
<br>
<h3><b>Types of Mineral Resources:</b></h3>
<br>
<p>Minerals in general have been categorized into three classes’ fuel, metallic and non-metallic. Fuel minerals like coal, oil and natural gas have been given prime importance as they account for nearly 87% of the value of mineral production whereas metallic and non-metallic constitutes 6 to 7%.
    </p>
    <h4><b>(A) Fuel Minerals:</b></h4>
    <p>Coal, oil and natural gas are the basic fossil fuel. We have good reserves for coal but are very poor in more essential fuel — oils and natural gas.</p>
<br>
    <h4><b>(i) Coal:</b></h4>
<br>
<p>Proven coal reserves of the country as on January 1994 (estimated by GSI) is about 68 billion tonnes. We are mining about 250 tonnes annually and this rate is expected to go by 400 – 450 tonnes by 2010 A.D. If we could maintain our mining rate of 400 tonnes per year then the coal reserves might last for about 200 years taking proven reserves as 80 billion tonnes.</p>
<br>
<h4><b>(ii) Crude Oil (Petroleum):</b></h4>
<p>It is believed that petroleum has been formed over a period of millions of years, through conversion of remains of micro organisms living in sea, into hydrocar­bon by heat, pressure and catalytic action. The petroleum on fractional distillation and further processing provides us nu­merous products and by-products.</p>
<br>
<p>Some of the common products obtained on fractional distillation are given in Table 2.4, along with the temperature (just below the boiling point) at which they tend to liquefy after crude oil feed at the base is heated to about 400°C. One million tonne of crude oil on fractional distil­lation provides about 0.8 million tonnes of petroleum products</p>
<br>
<p>The percentage composition varies with the quality of crude oil or it could be varied up to a certain limit depending upon the requirement or demand. On an average the percentage composition of the common product with their number of carbon atoms is given </p>
